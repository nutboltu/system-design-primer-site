### Learn how to design large-scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic.  There is a **vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web** on system design principles.

This repo is an **organized collection** of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

### Learn from the open source community

This is a continually updated, open source project.

[Contributions](#contributing) are welcome!

### Prep for the system design interview

In addition to coding interviews, system design is a **required component** of the **technical interview process** at many tech companies.

**Practice common system design interview questions** and **compare** your results with **sample solutions**: discussions, code, and diagrams.

Additional topics for interview prep:

* [Study guide](#study-guide)
* [How to approach a system design interview question](#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question)
* [System design interview questions, **with solutions**](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
* [Object-oriented design interview questions, **with solutions**](#object-oriented-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
* [Additional system design interview questions](#additional-system-design-interview-questions)
