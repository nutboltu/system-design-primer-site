[Source: Transitioning from RDBMS to NoSQL](https://www.infoq.com/articles/Transition-RDBMS-NoSQL)

Reasons for **SQL**:

- Structured data
- Strict schema
- Relational data
- Need for complex joins
- Transactions
- Clear patterns for scaling
- More established: developers, community, code, tools, etc
- Lookups by index are very fast

Reasons for **NoSQL**:

- Semi-structured data
- Dynamic or flexible schema
- Non-relational data
- No need for complex joins
- Store many TB (or PB) of data
- Very data intensive workload
- Very high throughput for IOPS

Sample data well-suited for NoSQL:

- Rapid ingest of clickstream and log data
- Leaderboard or scoring data
- Temporary data, such as a shopping cart
- Frequently accessed ('hot') tables
- Metadata/lookup tables
