New to system design?

First, you'll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

- Topics covered:
  - Vertical scaling
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Caching
  - Load balancing
  - Database replication
  - Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

  - [Clones](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
  - [Databases](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
  - [Caches](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
  - [Asynchronism](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

- **Performance** vs **scalability**
- **Latency** vs **throughput**
- **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.
